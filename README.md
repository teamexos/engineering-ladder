### Exos Engineering Ladder

At Exos, we are tasked with an important and challenging mission: **to ignite the hero in all of us**.<br>
We believe that creating an Engineering Ladder will help us achieve our mission because when performance standards are clearly defined in an engineering ladder:

* It provides a level playing field that promotes equity.
* Engineers know how to grow and can see themselves continuously improve.
* Managers have consistent, objective criteria on which to base promotions and compensation.
* We know what to expect of ourselves and each other, so we can focus on doing great work together.

There are two paths in our Engineering Ladder:

**Makers:** impact team success by delivering the software and product that customers value.<br>
**Managers:** impact team success by delivering and developing the people into high performing teams.
